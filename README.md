The Magnet Students Community (MSC) is a student organization that is spontaneously organized and fully autonomous. The organization aims to provide students with a platform for independent innovation, communication, and practical experience, facilitating mutual learning and exchange among students.

Its predecessor was the CTXD Magnet Brothers Alliance, founded by Comrade Zhou Xun.

As an autonomous organization, the management and operation of the Magnet Students Community (MSC) are also handled by the students themselves. Students collaborate and divide tasks, establish rules and regulations, and independently carry out various activities and affairs, demonstrating the spirit of self-management and self-revolution among students, proving that contemporary students are capable of striving for equality.
